## Introduction

This repository is a central place to keep code which I use to teach others, or
myself. Code here should not be assumed to be "production ready", and is all
provided for educational purposes.

## Conventions

The directory hierarchy of this project contains various examples of data
structures, algorithms, and programming languages. Typically, every such
directory will contain at least a `README.md` with information on what is being
demonstrated, and a `Makefile` such that running `make demo` will produce some
interesting output.
