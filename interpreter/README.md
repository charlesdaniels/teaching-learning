# Writing An Interpreter in Go In C

This is my attempt at following along with Thorsten Ball's [Writing an
Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/), but in C, since I have an
unrelated project that for which I will need to write a Pratt parser in C.

Note that this code tries to follow the book in a reasonably elegant way. It is
not intended to be robust or production-ready.
